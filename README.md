#  A Simple SQL Query Table for Books

## BOOKS

  > This repository contains the SQL scripts for managing a database of books and authors. The SQL scripts allow users to create a database, define tables, insert data, update records, delete entries, and perform various queries to retrieve information about books and authors.

## Features

 - **Database Creation:** The SQL scripts create a database named BooksDB to store information about books and authors.

- **Data Insertion:** The SQL scripts insert sample data into the Books and Authors tables to populate the database with initial records.

- **Data Manipulation:** Users can perform various operations such as updating book prices, deleting records, and modifying table structures using SQL commands.
